# trivia-game

* This is a trivia game, which shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, it shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it will display the next question, without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, it tells the player that time's up, and displays the correct answer. It will wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, it tells the player they selected the wrong option, and displays the correct answer. It will wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, it will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
